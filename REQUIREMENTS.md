## Requirements

The requirements below are broken into separate **tiers**, which model the way we **recommend you approach the project**. That is, we recommend you complete (or complete the majority of) the requirements in Tier 1 before moving on to Tier 2, and so on. Of course, if you get stuck on a particular feature, we recommend moving on and trying another feature - don't sacrifice the good for the perfect!
